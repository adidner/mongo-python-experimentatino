# mongo-python-experimentation


## Purpose
 
I wanted to get more familiar with MongoDB as it seems like a good choice for a a project I'm working on and my experince up to this point is largely with SQL DB's


## Plan

The project I eventually want to apply this to is based on Python and as such I'll be learning to use MongoDB in python via 2 youtube tutorials listed below

Tutorial and experimentation followed in the **mongo-crash-course-with-python-2022.py** file
